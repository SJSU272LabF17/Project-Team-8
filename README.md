**Project Title**: SJSU Centralized Student Assistant System

**Current Problem**: Students often need help in certain subjects in their class, certain topics, particular
skills they wish to learn or to talk about some of other issues they experience in general. Everyone as a
student possesses some skills, knowledge which other people may lack. The students lacking this skill set
can get help from the students having adequate skill set in that area. There isn’t a system which brings
together these set of people, one who needs assistance and set of people who are capable of providing
such help.

**Solution**: We aim to build a centralized system which will map students that need some assistance in
particular subjects or area with people who can provide such assistance or guidance. Each registered
student can raise their issue or requirement in the system and the system will map appropriate persons
who can provide the assistance or knowledge based on his/her registered skill sets and areas of interest.
Every student will be able to post rating about each other so that user can select the best person or in
case of his/her unavailability he/she can refer to another set of people with good rating..
Project Methodology: We will use MERN Stack to build the above system.
